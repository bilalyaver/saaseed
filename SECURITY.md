# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We currently support only the latest `main` branch for security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.  
Instead, report it privately to the maintainers:

Please include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact

We will:
1. Acknowledge your report within **48 hours**

3. Credit you (if desired) once the fix is public

## Disclosure Policy
We follow **responsible disclosure**: security issues are made public only
after a fix has been released.
